Create jagged array, fill it with integers and finally choose a sorting method.

This small program will test the creation of a jagged array of integer numbers, then the user
will choose a way to sort the array and display its contents.
This is practice for me to test the workings of an array and the algorithm needed to sort its contents.
At the end the array will be printed for the user with its new re-arrangment of the elements.
